This driver implements the Open Java API for OLAP (olap4j [1]). It can be used by clients that 
support the API, e.g., Saiku, Palo. It allows access to Linked Data sources. 
Those Linked Data sources are typically served over the Web by a triple store, e.g., Open Virtuoso, 
Sesame.

==Requirements==
* olap4ld requires xercesImpl from olap4j  

==How to run olap4ld with Saiku?==
* Saiku-ui is starting point
* Saiku-webapp is called by saiku-ui (in Saiku2.2 saiku-webapp should now be saiku)
* Saiku-webapp (saiku) needs to be configured to use olap4ld driver: saiku-datasources [1].
** The triple store queried so far is hard coded in the system. TODO: Configure named graphs, here.
* olap4ld is called by saiku-webapp (saiku)
* olap4j is implemented (and used) by olap4ld. 
* Mondrian.jar has once been used by olap4ld, but should not be necessary anymore.
* For OpenVirtuoso Triple Store, to transfrom sparql xml to nx, saxon.jar is needed. 
This library, I need to have in Deployment Assembly of saiku-webapp, as olap4ld needs it.
* The XSLT for transforming SPARQL XML into NX can be found within olap4ld.
* olap4ld requires the nx parser [2].
* Saiku-webapp requires as deployment assembly all libraries used by olap4ld.  

==olap4ld and SPARQL triple stores==
* olap4ld tries not to make use of SPARQL 1.1 functionality in order to be applicable to 
different triple stores
* So far, only tested with Open Virtuoso
* SPARQL features that olap4ld uses: ... AS ?... in select clause; if(?dimension = qb:dimension) 
in select clause; OPTIONAL {} in where clause; order by ?... ?...; iri(?dimension); bound(?dimension)

==Functionalities==
* Members
* Filter (but only up to 3 at the same time, otherwise it takes the first member, also,
only the case is covered, when each position in the filter is made of one member, no crossjoin)
* CrossJoin
* Not yet covered:
** Hierarchize, Order...

==Testing==
* olap4j has a testing environment which olap4ld uses
* olap4ld provides its own test.properties
* also olap4ld provides own test cases (preliminary)
