* Problem: If we run a test on data sources with metadata queries, olap4ld does not yet know
how to translate prefixes to URIs. If I run OLAP queries, it does not since it populates the object
metadata and gives names to all multidimensional elements. However, for metadata queries, it does
not do it. After a metadata query is issued, for output, the elements are translated to MDX 
expressions, i.e., after output, the prefixes are known. That means, for metadata queries, we have 
to first query for cubes, then dimensions, then hierarchies etc.

* Measures and aggregation functions: We say that the aggregation function of a measure is inherent 
to the measure, i.e., it has to define itself how it aggregates if viewed from a lower granularity.
From a measure, you can always derive new measures.

* When filtering for members in SSB, I had to use function str(), otherwise I got an error "Virtuoso 22005 Error SR130 Bad type VARCHAR".
